        "\n",
        "In this exercise you will implement a linear image classifier while getting familiar with `numpy` and the benefits of vectorized operations in Python. This exercise has 2 parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Implementing loss functions, calculating gradients and implementing gradient descent.\n",
        "2. Training and evaluating several classifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Submission guidelines:\n",
        "\n",
        "Your submission should only include this jupyter notebook named HW1_ID.ipynb.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Read the following instructions carefully:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. This jupyter notebook contains all the step by step instructions needed for this exercise.\n",
        "2. Write **efficient vectorized** code whenever instructed. \n",
        "3. You are responsible for the correctness of your code and should add as many tests as you see fit. Tests will not be graded nor checked.\n",
        "4. Do not change the functions we provided you. \n",
        "4. Write your functions in the instructed python modules only. All the logic you write is imported and used using this jupyter notebook. You are allowed to add functions as long as they are located in the python modules and are imported properly.\n",
        "5. You are allowed to use functions and methods from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/) only. Any other imports are forbidden.\n",
        "6. Your code must run without errors.\n",
        "7. Answers to qualitative questions should be written in **markdown** cells (with $\\LaTeX$ support).\n",
        "8. **TIP: When there is a TODO before a missing code segment (or function), you can continue without implementing it right away; you will be referred to the missing segment later in the exercise.**"

        "\n",
        "Q: How do I make sure everything works before I submit?\n",
